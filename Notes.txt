command [arg1 .. argN]

command1 [args] | command2 [args]               < iterator piping

  first command receives empty-iterator, commands in the middle of the
  pipeline receive their previous command's output iterator, command at the
  end receives a stdout-output-iterator. each command is executed using a
  shellplugin-command-execution-command which looks through the PluginRegistry
  for methods to execute

command "quotes bind | a string"                < quoting
